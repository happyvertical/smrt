# smrt-core/schema paths

Module semantics for `src/schema/` — which `SchemaGenerator` entry point reaches
a real database, what each one emits, and the rules that keep them in step.
Package orientation, the cross-module invariants, and the traps that apply
before editing anything live in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — read that first;
its "Schema paths" section is the short form of everything below.

Written from the 2026-08-17 database-layer gap assessment (epic #2382). Symbol
names here are stable; the line numbers the assessment quotes are not, so trust
this call graph and re-grep before citing a location.

## Five entry points, two of which ship

`src/schema/generator.ts` exposes five index-emitting entry points. They do not
produce the same schema for the same class.

| Entry point | Selected by | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `generateSTISchemaFromManifest` | `src/scanner/manifest-generator.ts` | **production** |
| `generateCTISchemaFromManifest` | `src/scanner/manifest-generator.ts` | **production** |
| `generateSTISchemaFromRegistry` | `src/testing/database.ts` (`getTestDatabase()`), `src/schema/utils.ts` (`generateSchema`; `ensureSchema` only as a fallback) | tests + runtime helpers |
| `generateSchemaFromRegistry` | the same two callers | tests + runtime helpers |
| `generateSchema` (AST) | the `smrt:schema` virtual module, which has no consumer | dead (#2380) |

Production DDL takes the manifest route:

```
@smrt() class ─▶ scanner ─▶ manifest.json ─▶ generate{STI,CTI}SchemaFromManifest
              ─▶ registered `schema` ─▶ ObjectRegistry.getAllSchemasAsDefinitions()
                 ├─▶ smrt db:migrate | db:diff | db:status
                 │     (the CLI drives SchemaComparer + MigrationTracker directly)
                 └─▶ migrateSmrtSchemas() / getPendingSchemaStatements()
                       (src/migrations/orchestrate.ts — exported for programmatic
                        use; no in-repo caller outside its own tests)
```

The suite takes the registry route. Before #2359 the registry route emitted
indexes the manifest route did not — per-column foreign-key indexes, and STI
partial FK indexes filtered by `_meta_type` — so tests ran against a richer
schema than any deployment received, the manifest STI path populated a
`fkColumnsByClass` map it never read, and the manifest CTI path had no FK loop
at all. `src/testing/database.ts`'s "same as migrations" comment described an
intent, not the code.

Since #2359 the two families share one set of index helpers and
`src/schema/schema-path-parity.test.ts` runs the same fixture manifest through
the manifest paths, through `ObjectRegistry.registerFromManifest()` + the
registry paths, and through `getAllSchemasAsDefinitions()`, asserting identical
column and index sets. Extend that fixture with every generator change; a
divergence is a bug in the generator, not an exception to add to the test.

### Index rules (#2359)

- **Reference columns are always indexed.** `ensureReferenceColumnIndexes()`
  runs last on every path and gives each `@foreignKey`, `@crossPackageRef` and
  tenant column `<table>_<column>_idx` unless an UNQUALIFIED index (no `WHERE`,
  no JSON path) already leads with it — the `conflictColumns` unique index or an
  `indexed: true` opt-in, or the column's own inline UNIQUE. A partial
  `WHERE _meta_type = …` index does not count: base-class polymorphic queries
  carry no discriminator predicate. `indexed: true` on a reference column is
  redundant. Roll the index wave out to production with
  `smrt db:migrate --postgres-safe` (concurrent-index mode, #2362): a plain
  atomic batch takes SHARE/ACCESS EXCLUSIVE locks for ~230 index builds. STI FK indexes are plain, one per
  column, not per-class partial.
- **No index on the primary key.** `<table>_id_idx` is gone from every path,
  and `conflictColumns` equal to the PK column set emit no conflict index
  (`ON CONFLICT (id)` binds to the PK constraint). `SchemaComparer` drops the
  legacy non-unique single-column PK index from existing databases without
  `--drop-indexes` when the live table reports that column as its sole primary
  key (never a UNIQUE one — on PostgreSQL that may back a custom-named PRIMARY
  KEY constraint, and `DROP INDEX` on it would fail the atomic batch).
- **Slug loading keeps its index.** Custom `conflictColumns` replace the
  `(slug, context)` unique index; `loadFromSlug()`/`getId()`/`getSavedId()`
  still filter on slug/context, so a plain `<table>_slug_context_idx` is kept
  (additive; routing those lookups through the conflict key would change which
  row a slug resolves to).
- **STI `@field({ unique: true })` is enforced through indexes** (the differ can
  add an index to an existing table, never a column constraint): a full
  `<table>_<col>_unique_idx` when the STI base declares it, one
  `<table>_<col>_<class>_unique_idx WHERE _meta_type = '<qualified>'` per class
  when only descendants do — uniqueness per concrete class, not across the
  subtree. DuckDB/JSON have no partial indexes, so the descendant-scoped shape
  (`isStiSubtypeUniqueIndex`) is not emitted there — degrading it to a full
  UNIQUE would constrain every subtype; the DDL strategy and the differ both
  skip it, while other partial indexes keep degrading to full ones as before. Remember the
  framework serializes an unset text field as `''`, so a unique optional text
  field must be `nullable: true` with a `null` initializer or every unset row
  collides.
- **Every class in an STI hierarchy carries the schema of the one shared
  table**, generated from the root base (`ManifestGenerator.generateSchemas()`
  resolves the root through `findSTIBaseInfo`), so a child never treats its own
  descendant-only unique field as base-declared.

`src/schema/utils.ts` sits in between, and the two exports differ:

- `generateSchema()` (reached from `SmrtCollection.generateSchema()`) always
  rebuilds from the registry and writes the result back into the registry,
  replacing whatever the manifest registered for that class.
- `ensureSchema()` (reached from the deprecated `smrt db:setup`) is
  manifest-first: it takes `ObjectRegistry.getSchema()` plus the merged
  `getAllSchemasAsDefinitions()` table definition, and only falls back to
  `generateSchema()` when no schema is registered at all.

So a normal build keeps the manifest schema through `db:setup`, and a
registry-derived schema is a dev/test artifact. `smrt-content` shows what one
looks like: `packages/content/src/hooks.server.ts` `bootstrapSchema()` calls
`generateSchema()` for every registered class and then `ensureSchema()` from the
SvelteKit `handle` hook on any `/api/*` request, so that process holds
registry-derived schemas rather than the manifest ones. It reaches only that
package's own `vite dev` app — the library build excludes the file and the
package never exports it — but it is the shape to recognize. Check which route a
process actually took before trusting a reproduction.

## Why the drift stayed invisible

Every drift oracle compares a database with the same artifact that dropped the
index:

- `verifyPersistenceTable()` (`src/schema/table-verifier.ts`) calls
  `db.tableExists()` and nothing else. "Runtime verifies schema" has always meant
  existence-only — no column, type, constraint, or index comparison.
- `smrt doctor` never opens a database connection.
- `db:status` and `db:diff` diff the live database against
  `getAllSchemasAsDefinitions()`, i.e. the manifest projection.

An index the manifest never emitted is "in sync" by construction. That is how a
production database reached 164 unindexed `tenant_id` columns while `db:status`
reported no drift (#2356 → #2359). The assessment's other counts — 196/231
`@foreignKey` and 91/92 `@crossPackageRef` columns with no production index,
238/238 tables carrying a redundant index on the primary key, zero DB-level
foreign-key constraints on any engine — come from regenerating every package's
schema against a live database, so re-measure rather than quote them once the
epic's fixes land.

## Rules

### 1. Verify against the production path, not the test path

Any change to column or index emission goes on **all** paths that ship and is
proven by the path-parity test (`src/schema/schema-path-parity.test.ts`, #2359)
— extend its fixture; a green suite otherwise proves the registry paths only.
Read the call graph before believing a comment: "same as migrations" was wrong
for years.

### 2. Every new query predicate ships with its index

Collection methods, poll loops, auth lookups, junction right-side filters, and
polymorphic owner lookups all count — or write down why the predicate does not
need one. For list workloads, EXPLAIN on a PostgreSQL snapshot; the measured
spread on the assessed workload was 21 ms → 0.1 ms.

### 3. Run the PostgreSQL lane

Anything touching numeric types, uuid casts, upsert conflict targets, timestamps,
or migrations runs the package's `test:postgres` script:

```bash
pnpm --filter @happyvertical/smrt-<pkg> test:postgres
```

core, cli, users, sales, marketing, analytics, and vitest carry the lane.
SQLite's type affinity accepts values PostgreSQL rejects — a money field declared
`number = 0` compiles to INTEGER and only fails on PG (#2361).

### 4. Read the built artifact, not the source

What a decorator produced is in `dist/manifest.json` and in regenerated schemas:
`integer` vs `decimal`, the actual index list, the actual conflict columns. When
the question is "how many tables/columns/indexes", regenerate and count across
every package; do not sample a few and extrapolate.

### 5. Index intent belongs on both the constraint and the read path

A conflict target is not automatically a unique index, and a unique index is not
automatically the index a read path uses. Custom `conflictColumns` used to
replace the `(slug, context)` index while `loadFromSlug`/`getId` still queried
slug+context, and STI dropped `@field({ unique: true })` — both fixed in #2359,
see "Index rules" above. Check the pair, not the declaration.

### 6. Multi-tenancy is a whole-path property

Every unique constraint and every conflict target on a tenant-scoped table
includes the tenant column — otherwise a second tenant's `save()` of the same
natural key updates the first tenant's row through `DO UPDATE SET` (#2360). And
every read path is interceptor-aware: hydration (`loadFromId`/`loadFromSlug`),
get-by-slug, vector search, and collection memory, not only `list()` (#2365).

### 7. Retry only transient errors

Classify through the cause chain (SQLSTATE), never on a message substring, and
never retry inside an aborted PostgreSQL transaction (`25P02`). Test the
contract end to end against a real database, not only the classifier (#2366).

### 8. Thread new decorator options through every config-rebuild site

A new `@smrt()` or `@field()` option that affects schema must reach the
`SchemaGeneratorConfig` type in `src/schema/generator.ts` and every site that
rebuilds that config — `src/schema/utils.ts` and `src/testing/database.ts` — or
it is silently dropped on the paths that rebuild it (#2357).

### 9. Delete or wire dead paths, and write docs to what the code does

Dead code that looks canonical misleads the next agent: the AST `generateSchema`
path, `SchemaOverrideSystem`, and the never-emitted `triggers: []` all read as
supported surfaces (#2380). Documentation follows the implementation, not the
intent — say "verifies the table exists" when that is what runs.

### 10. Untracked "known limitation" comments are bugs nobody will read

File the issue and link it from the comment. A `products` comment explaining why
a conflict-column change was refrained from sat there for months — and
misdescribed the failure mode the whole time.

### 11. Consumer repair scripts are signals

Downstream repair tooling (anytown's `db-repair-plan.ts` carried column-type
repairs, missing STI columns and indexes, and `tenant_id` backfills since April)
is the consumer-side record of framework gaps. Mine it during triage.

### 12. Try to falsify before filing, and treat operations as correctness

Re-verify a finding at source before it becomes an issue — one assessment
candidate claimed conflict indexes past two columns were narrowed to two
columns, when only the index *name* is shortened. And an index fix that ships
without a bounded-timeout, `CONCURRENTLY`-capable migrate path can take
production down on rollout (#2362).

### 13. Composite indexes are declared, not inferred (#2357)

The generated set only covers foreign keys, unique/conflict columns, the STI
discriminator, reference columns (#2359), the default list ordering (rule 17
below), and single columns opted in with `@field({ indexed: true })`. A list
workload's access path is composite, so declare it:

```ts
@smrt({
  indexes: [
    { name: 'contents_tenant_id_publish_date_idx',
      columns: ['tenantId', 'publish_date'] },
  ],
})
```

`columns` takes field names or column names in access-path order — filter
columns first, sort column last. Declare columns, not a direction: PostgreSQL
scans a btree either way, so an ascending index also serves the matching
`ORDER BY ... DESC` as an ordered scan with no Sort node. `unique` and `where`
(partial index) are honoured.

`appendDeclaredIndexes()` runs first on all five entry points, ahead of
`ensureDefaultListOrderingIndex()` (rule 17) and `ensureReferenceColumnIndexes()`,
so a declared composite leading with the tenant column replaces the automatic
standalone `tenant_id` index rather than duplicating it.
Unknown columns, malformed entries, and a name collision with a different index
all fail generation — a silently dropped index only surfaces later as a
production slowdown. Rule 8 above is why this works at runtime at all.

### 14. Relationship targets resolve to a class name on both paths

`@foreignKey`/`@oneToMany`/`@manyToMany` accept a class, a name string, or a
`() => Target` thunk. The decorator invokes the thunk and throws when the target
cannot be resolved (never `related: ''`); the scanner unwraps the same thunk
from raw source (never `related: '() => Target'`). An unresolved target silently
costs the relationship edge, `loadRelated()`, and the FK-derived index (#2379).
A thunk resolves at decoration time, so a target declared later in the same
module is still in its temporal dead zone — use the string form there.

### 15. A SQLite type change is a table rebuild (#2370)

SQLite has no `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE`, so
`src/migrations/sqlite-rebuild.ts` answers a `type_upgrade` on SQLite with the
statement list SQLite's own docs prescribe: stage a new table under
`_smrt_rebuild_<table>`, copy, drop, rename, replay the indexes and triggers.
`SchemaComparer.compareTable` swaps that plan in for the differ's
"requires table recreation" placeholder, so `db:migrate` applies it inside the
normal atomic batch instead of exiting 1 forever.

Four properties of that module are load-bearing; keep them if you touch it:

- **The target shape comes from the live `sqlite_master` DDL**, retyping only
  the drifted columns. It is not regenerated from the manifest, so the rebuild
  never becomes an implicit `DROP COLUMN`, and it preserves table constraints,
  `CHECK`s, and `WITHOUT ROWID`/`STRICT`.
- **The rebuild is hoisted ahead of the table's other column changes.** Its
  staging DDL and copy list are captured at diff time, and the differ emits
  changes in manifest field order, so a new field declared above the retyped
  one would otherwise run `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` first and have the
  rebuild silently drop it — both statements succeed and the batch commits.
  Rebuild first, then add columns to the rebuilt table.
- **The copy carries no `CAST`.** SQLite applies the destination column's
  affinity on insert — the same conversion a fresh table performs. An explicit
  cast is worse: non-numeric TEXT cast to REAL/INTEGER silently becomes `0`,
  and an ISO timestamp cast to NUMERIC-affinity `DATETIME` becomes its year.
- **It refuses when any table has a foreign key onto the target and
  `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is ON** (the SMRT adapter's default). `DROP TABLE`
  performs an implicit `DELETE FROM` that fires `ON DELETE CASCADE` on
  children, and `defer_foreign_keys` defers constraint *checks*, not FK
  *actions* — verified: the child rows go. The target's own self-reference
  counts, because the staging table copies that clause and becomes a child of
  the table being dropped (verified: a two-row self-referencing table finishes
  the rebuild holding one row). Such a column stays manual drift.
- **`PRAGMA legacy_alter_table` brackets the rename**, because SQLite ≥ 3.25
  re-parses the schema on `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` and a view still pointing at
  the just-dropped table makes it fail outright. It is restored immediately
  after; a rolled-back batch leaves it set on that connection, which is inert
  here only because nothing else in SMRT renames a table.

All the drifted columns of one table share a single rebuild: the first change
carries the plan and the rest become `no change needed` comments that the CLI
classifies as no-ops.

## What the differ compares (#2369)

`SchemaComparer` (`src/migrations/differ.ts`) compares each manifest column's
type, then — unless the type itself is drifting — its nullability and default,
and always reports what it will not touch:

- **Strengthening** (`SET NOT NULL`, `SET DEFAULT`) is executable on
  PostgreSQL/DuckDB. `SET NOT NULL` is preceded by an `UPDATE … WHERE c IS NULL`
  backfill of the manifest default; without a default the live data is probed
  and, if NULLs exist, the change is reported (comment SQL + `advisory`) instead
  of emitting an ALTER that would abort the atomic batch.
- **Relaxing** (`DROP NOT NULL`, `DROP DEFAULT`) is a report-only advisory until
  the caller passes `relaxColumns` (`db:migrate --relax-columns`). The manifest
  can be under-specified (#2372 registration-order weakness), so a live column
  that is stricter than the manifest is never weakened silently.
- **Orphans** — DB columns absent from the manifest, DB tables no manifest
  declares (`SchemaDiff.orphan_tables`), and unclaimed `*_key` unique constraint
  indexes — are always reported. A NOT NULL orphan without a default is a
  `warning` advisory (every ORM insert fails on it); `includeDroppedColumns`
  (`--drop-columns`) drops it, `relaxColumns` relaxes it. Advisory-only changes
  carry no SQL, never reach the tracker, and do not fail `db:migrate`.
- **ADD COLUMN** is planned per engine: DuckDB rejects every inline constraint
  (add with `DEFAULT`, then `SET NOT NULL`, `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`); SQLite
  rejects inline `UNIQUE` (separate `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX <table>_<col>_key`, the
  PostgreSQL constraint-index name, so the orphan sweep leaves it alone) and
  `NOT NULL` without a default on a populated table; PostgreSQL keeps constraints
  inline. DuckDB has no `ADD CONSTRAINT`, so the separate index is the only
  way to add uniqueness there; the bundled DuckDB 1.4.x resolves
  `ON CONFLICT (col)` through that index (the old #12684 limitation the DuckDB
  strategy's `requiresInlineUnique()` note describes no longer reproduces —
  the #2369 DuckDB test pins the upsert), older DuckDB builds may not. A required column with no default is enforced only on an empty table;
  on a populated one it is added nullable and the `NOT NULL` is reported as a
  manual follow-up on every engine.
- **SQLite** has no `ALTER COLUMN`: nullability/default alterations are manual
  (comment SQL → `db:migrate` exit 1). The #2370 rebuild (rule 15) consumes
  only `type_upgrade` placeholders today; extending it to rewrite constraints
  would lift this.
- Defaults compare through `canonicalizeDefault()`, which folds engine
  renderings (`'x'::text`, `CAST('t' AS BOOLEAN)`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` vs
  `now()`) by manifest type; an unclassifiable rendering skips the comparison
  rather than risking a false positive that would churn every run. The
  round-trip test (create from each DDL strategy → compare → zero changes) in
  `src/migrations/__tests__/issue-2369-*.test.ts` guards this.

### 16. `schema.ddl` is a preview, not the table

`SchemaDefinition.ddl` / `manifest.json` `schema.ddl` is the engine-neutral
CREATE TABLE string from `SchemaGenerator.generateSQL()` with no engine: no
indexes, no triggers, abstract `REAL`/`JSON`/`UUID`/`TIMESTAMP`. It is kept for
backward compatibility only. Everything that needs an executable table renders
`columns` + `indexes` through `getDDLStrategy(engine)` — `db:migrate`
(`migrations/orchestrate.ts`), `MigrationGenerator` (default
`materializeStructuredSchema: true`; `false` is a deprecated opt-out),
`SchemaAggregator`, and `createIsolatedTestDbFromManifest` in smrt-vitest, the
last two via `src/schema/manifest-schema.ts` (`collectManifestTables` /
`renderCollectedManifestTable`). The cached string is merged in only for a
table whose contributors expose no structured columns (hand-authored
manifests); table constraints that exist only in the string are dropped with a
warning, as `db:migrate` drops them. Do not add a new consumer of the
string, and do not write a private CREATE INDEX renderer — the retired ones
dropped `where` and `jsonPath` (#2358). Every DDL strategy also spells out
`PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL`: SQLite lets a bare non-INTEGER PRIMARY KEY hold NULL.

### 17. The generator owns the index for its own default ordering (#2363)

Every generated list surface — REST, MCP, the SvelteKit list route — pages with
`ORDER BY created_at DESC, <pk> ASC` (`DEFAULT_LIST_ORDER_BY`, #2367), and
until #2363 no schema path indexed `created_at` (the dead AST path indexed
`updated_at`), so the framework's own default page was a sequential scan plus a
top-N sort. `ensureDefaultListOrderingIndex()` now runs on all five paths and
emits:

- `(<tenant column>, created_at)` on a tenant-scoped table — the tenancy
  interceptor puts `tenant_id = ?` in front of every list, so the tenant column
  leads and `created_at` orders within it. This composite **replaces** the
  standalone tenant index from #2359: a B-tree serves every prefix of its
  column list, so `ensureDefaultListOrderingIndex()` is called first and
  `ensureReferenceColumnIndexes()` then sees the column as already served. The
  tenant column is found by `referenceKind === 'tenantId'`, never by the
  `tenant_id` spelling — `@smrt({ tenantScoped: { field } })` renames it.
- `(created_at)` otherwise.

Three deliberate omissions, so nobody "fixes" them later:

- **No `DESC`.** `IndexDefinition` carries no per-column direction and
  PostgreSQL scans a B-tree backwards just as cheaply.
- **No primary-key tiebreak column.** The default order mixes directions
  (`created_at DESC, id ASC`), so no single-direction index satisfies the whole
  key; the leading columns already turn a full sort into an index scan plus an
  incremental sort over rows sharing a timestamp.
- **Not scoped per STI subtype.** `(_meta_type, created_at)` would serve a
  child collection's list but not the base class's polymorphic one, which
  carries no discriminator predicate — the same reasoning that keeps STI
  reference indexes plain (#2359). One unqualified index per shared table.

An existing UNQUALIFIED index that already leads with the same columns
suppresses it — a partial or JSON-path index never counts. That is how a
declared `@smrt({ indexes: [...] })` composite (#2357) takes over: declaring
`(tenant_id, created_at, status)` replaces the generated pair, while declaring
a different sort column such as `(tenant_id, publish_date)` sits **beside** it,
because that index cannot order the default page. Declared indexes are appended
before this helper for exactly that reason; anything that appends an index in
future goes in the same slot, ahead of `ensureDefaultListOrderingIndex()` and
`ensureReferenceColumnIndexes()`.
