# App-shell engine (`src/engine`)

Runs a person's own smrt app from a versioned JSON definition. The host
(`AppHost`) owns the version history (through a `VersionStore`) and the data
directory; the app itself runs in a worker thread with its own registry and
`app.db`. Every definition change starts a fresh worker (the registry only
adds) and swaps it in once it is ready. The engine must not import SvelteKit,
`$lib`, or anything under `src/lib`.

## Rules

- **Approval gate.** `RISKY_COMMANDS`, `isRiskyCommand` and `isRiskyTool` live
  in `commands.ts`. `execute` throws `ApprovalRequiredError` for a risky
  command without `approved: true`; `callAppTool` does the same for
  `<model>_delete`, and `rest` for `DELETE`. Approval covers the command, not a
  plan hash: the plan is recomputed at execute time.
- **Queue.** Work inside the change queue must call `callApp`, never `onApp`
  (which awaits the queue): the old `clean_up` deadlock.
- **Migrations** (`app-runtime.ts`) run in one transaction in the new worker,
  reading through the transaction handle. Destructive ones retire the old worker
  first and restart the old definition if the new one fails. They are
  SQLite-shaped (`RENAME/DROP COLUMN`, `VACUUM INTO`, `pragma_table_info`);
  Postgres is future work.
- **Column storage.** No column-type history: re-adding a field checks the real
  column's storage family. Text defaults can be `''`, so counts and archives use
  `IS NOT NULL AND <> ''`. Renames do not rewrite method code; the plan lists
  `affectedMethods`.
- **App subclass rule.** `enableRecipe('profiles')` adds the app model
  `Profile` (`extends` the shipped class). Its fields are nullable columns on
  the shipped `profiles` table (STI). Never subclass `ProfileType` (its
  subclass would get its own table). Creating a Profile find-or-creates the real
  `person` `ProfileType`.
- **Sandbox** (`sandbox.ts`): QuickJS, pure function over a copy of the data.
  Everything crossing the boundary is JSON text. Limits: time, memory, a small
  stack (128 KB), 1000 writes, 1 MB output, 8 MB input. The body is checked as a
  function body by V8 first (QuickJS's own `Function` accepts a body that closes
  the wrapper). Writes are validated and a `VACUUM INTO` snapshot is taken before
  they are applied.

## Profile subclass (core gap fixed, #4871)

The app subclass of the shipped `Profile` is registered as
`@local/app:Profile`, the same class name as its parent. Core keeps the two
apart: `registerRuntimeModel` leaves a same-named parent registered (constructor
index, no lineage replacement), and the parent's generated REST and MCP
surfaces are closed with `ObjectRegistry.registerOverride(parent, { api: false,
mcp: false })` in `AppRuntime.register`, so only the subclass's tools exist.
Covered by core's `runtime-model.test.ts` and engine `profile-subclass.test.ts`.

## Safety rules added in review

- **Undo is gated when it overwrites data.** `undo` is not in `RISKY_COMMANDS`;
  the host decides from the *stored* version (`analyseUndo`): a version with a
  `convertColumn` step restores each row's archived original on the way back,
  replacing values written since, so the plan is `risky` with a read-only
  `countOverwrites` preview (`replaced`, `fields[]`). Every other undo stays
  immediate. The shell pins the approval to that version (`undo.version`); the
  host refuses if the app moved on.
- **REST surface.** `restRouteAllowed` (definition.ts) lets only
  `/api/<route>` and `/api/<route>/<id|action>` of the app's own models through,
  in `AppHost.rest` and `AppRuntime.rest`. Core's reserved `sync/apply` (its
  `delete` op deletes records), `_changes`/`_events`/`_inference` and the
  registry fallback to shipped classes (e.g. `ProfileType`) are 404 before the
  DELETE gate. `DELETE` on an allowed route still needs approval.
- **Snapshot retention** (`snapshots.ts`): the worker keeps the newest 20
  `method-*` snapshots after each new one; `cleanUp` removes `migrate-*` and
  `schema-*` snapshots older than the newest change it purges. Only plain files
  matching the engine's own name pattern in `snapshots/` are ever deleted
  (never symlinks, directories or other files).
- **importTemplate preview** lists every method (model, name, description,
  params, code), so what the owner approves is what is shown; a template with
  more than 200,000 characters of method code is refused as unreviewable.

## Lessons

- A worker must not be terminated while `@happyvertical/sql`'s startup HMAC key
  job is pending (Node aborts the process); `app-worker.ts` settles it before
  reporting ready.
- If V8 overflows its own stack inside WebAssembly, QuickJS cannot recover; the
  small QuickJS stack limit keeps its error first, and a host-level failure
  discards the WASM module instance.
