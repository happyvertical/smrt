# @happyvertical/smrt-app-runtime

Reusable infrastructure composition for s-m-r-t applications. The package
implements the validated profiles from `@happyvertical/smrt-config` without
forking domain objects, generated surfaces, effects, approvals, or job calls.

## Private local applications

```ts
import {
  initializeLocalApplicationRuntime,
} from '@happyvertical/smrt-app-runtime';

const { runtime, bootstrap, diagnostics } =
  await initializeLocalApplicationRuntime({
    appId: 'my-app',
    sourceRoot: process.cwd(),
    prepareDatabase: runApplicationMigrations,
  });

// Show bootstrap.token only in the loopback onboarding URL. The plaintext is
// returned once and only its HMAC is persisted.
```

The default data directory is the current user's OS application-data directory
(`~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows, or
`$XDG_DATA_HOME` / `~/.local/share` on Linux). It contains a mode-0600 SQLite
database, a user-owned asset directory, and generated mode-0600 application
secret material. Placing this directory inside the source checkout is refused.
Every existing path component is opened without following symbolic links and
checked against its canonical path before descendants or secret bytes are
written. The runtime then acquires SQLite through `@happyvertical/sql`'s
explicit `node:sqlite` trusted-parent custody boundary, rooted at the mode-0700
application data directory. Unsupported runtimes or platforms and unsafe
ownership, permissions, ACLs, or path components fail closed.

The custody boundary prevents static link traversal and mutation by other OS
principals while the application retains control of that directory. Hostile
code already running as the same user is outside this boundary; isolating
same-account processes requires an OS sandbox and a descriptor-relative SQLite
VFS.

Owner onboarding binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and rejects non-loopback hosts.
The first valid claim creates a real global `Person`, `User`, default `Tenant`,
owner `Role` / `Membership`, and server-side `Session` atomically. Startup and
setup are idempotent; replayed, expired, or concurrent claims fail closed.

Background jobs and application-defined paid capabilities remain disabled until
explicitly enabled. With embedded job topology, `createEmbeddedJobRunner()`
returns the normal s-m-r-t `TaskRunner`, so the application keeps one enqueue
and execution contract without requiring a separate worker service.
